# Spotify Playlist Creator



### Introduction
<hr>

The goal of this project is to be able to generate a new playlist from a Spotify user's personalized daylist. Every 
Spotify user has access to their "daylist," an auto-generated playlist based on a user's listening habits at a 
specific time of day. 

Let's say I check my daylist on a Thursday morning, all the songs in it will be based on 
music I typically listen to at that time of day. As you can see below, there are key descriptive words associated 
with my Thursday morning listening habits, such as "ethereal pop" or "balearic beat."

These key-words, along with the songs in the daylist, are updated every few hours or so throughout the day. For this 
website, the user is able to click any of the key-words (shown in the bottom list next to "Show Daylist") and see a 
different playlist Spotify generates for that key-word(s). This is in addition to being able to show the user's 
current daylist with the "Show Daylist" button along the bottom list.
